D'Addario, 2 months old: 1:58
D'Addario, after the slap hack (played like garbage but remember, it's just about the tone ðŸ™ƒ): 2:51
Elixir, brand new: 4:06

I've had D'Addario strings on my bass for the past couple years, changing them once in a while, and I love how they sound in the beginning, but they quickly lose their "new string" tone, which is sad because I'm really digging that tone.

Elixir strings with their ultra-thin NANOWEB coating are supposed to preserve the tone much longer, so I've got my hand on a set of those to compare. I was worried the tone wouldn't be as good as brand new D'Addario ones in the first place because of the coating, but I was surprised to get that crisp tone that I love as well. I'll do an update after a while of using them to see if they kept that tone or not.
