In this video I teach you the 7 pillars that I identified as key to slapping the bass!

00:00 Intro
01:24 My perspective on slap
02:04 PILLAR 1: Thumb technique
04:39 PILLAR 2, 3, 4: Sliding, tapping and pulling (hammer-on and pull-off)
06:34 PILLAR 5: Popping
08:33 PILLAR 6: Independent rhythm hand (key to groove)
11:52 Bonus: "double pull" (sweet tasty sound)
13:22 The most important advice IMO
14:15 PILLAR 7: Groove with sixteenth notes
16:06 Conclusion

I initially recorded this nearly 2 years ago and for some reason never finished editing it, but I recently stumbled upon those clips again and decided to put in the time to release this tutorial. Very happy I finally did that! Better late than never.
