There was a cool mix I liked many years ago called Funktionality, and I liked it so much I downloaded it from YouTube on my hard drive.

I found out recently all the original videos were gone, and other people on the internet were looking for them, so I figured I'd reupload them on YouTube. But I didn't download the original thumbnails, I had just the audio!

In this video, we recreate the Funktionality thumbnail from scratch. A good way to learn a thing or two about Photoshop.

Sorry for the video of me on the bottom right hiding some of the Photoshop UI... didn't think about this lol.

BTW you can find the reuploaded mixes here! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD4Zt85wsgxuuqHkPe0yqpA/videos
