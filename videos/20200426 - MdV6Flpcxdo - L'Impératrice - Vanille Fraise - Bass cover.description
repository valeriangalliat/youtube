First published attempt to record outdoors, pretty happy with the result technically, but it was a massive PITA with the stretched earbuds cable getting caught in the bass, no signal feedback, my left arm slowly sunburning, the tight space where I can easily scratch my bass against the wall or fence, and trying to read the tabs on my laptop despite the screen glare, hence my less than content face.

Still worth it though, hoping to make more of those in the future!
