Also referred to as "murder your darlings" 🔪 this content creation technique is one of the most important in my opinion especially if you're beginning.

Yesterday I received an (automated 😅) email from Casey Neistat titled "The first video I ever made", which starts with "I used every single shot I took [...], it was probably the worst video I've ever made" highlighting how important of a mistake this is.

This point is shared by other highly respected editors, for example somewhere in this video (https://youtu.be/O6ERELse_QY) by Taran Van Hemert, editor at Linus Tech Tips, which is where I first heard about this idea, or in this other video by Hillier Smith (https://youtu.be/KOQG1Js-4Mg) where he mentions cutting 70% of a video, and turning 2 hours of footage in a 5 minutes video!

It's something I've struggled with quite a long time and am still fighting constantly. In this video I share a few thoughts and ideas on how to be less attached to your content in order to make better videos, and hacks that will allow you to cut more of what you shot without feeling like you're sacrificing your children to the gods of watch time.
