Time for a new adventure! With a bunch of my climber friends, we went to Larouche crag (Quebec) to crush a bunch of routes during the whole week-end.

It's an amazing spot for top rope, you can just hike to the top to setup the anchor and rappel down. Lots of cool routes, and amazing view of the Larouche lake and the surrounding hills from the top.

We wild camped for two nights in the forest at on the top, which was a cool experience. Really convenient to be right at the crag early in the morning, and enjoying breakfast from the summit with a gorgeous view was fantastic.

I can't really film at the same time as I climb or belay so it was a bit tricky to make a vlog there, but I still managed to get some cool climbing shots!

Enjoy. üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
