Bridge at 2:18 followed by slap.

Background track taken from the theme song of the show (https://youtu.be/FYHguC8aVro), as the album version doesn't have that cool solo guitar cocotte in the beginning. However it's missing the same cocotte with chords at the end, which is on the album version (https://youtu.be/26yLwrPhOEs) so I made some kind of mix to get both because why not.

Most of them smooth groovy slap licks are from this fucking awesome cover (https://youtu.be/1lYlRiBzfaI) I'm not even close to that level but I had to try.

BTW if you're trying to do a cover as well, the BPM is 115.95 and not 116, you'll be off by half a beat or so at the end otherwise. Took me a while to figure this one out.
