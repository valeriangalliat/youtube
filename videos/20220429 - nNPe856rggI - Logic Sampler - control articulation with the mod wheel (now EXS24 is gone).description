Here's a cool trick that I initially did in the EXS24 plugin and had to find the proper way to do with the new Sampler plugin that replaced it.

This technique allows you to change an instrument articulation by using the mod wheel, defining regions that are assigned to a specific articulation.

It doesn't only work with articulations, and can be used with any sample group really!

It wasn't very intuitive to find this setting but there's a special "mapping" table where you can show extra columns that are hidden by default to assign mod wheel regions as well as many other parameters.
