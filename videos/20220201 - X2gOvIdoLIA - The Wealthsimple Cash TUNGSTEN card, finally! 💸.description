When Wealthsimple Cash launched its debit card, they claimed it would be made of tungsten. They later rolled back this decision for valid environmental reasons and shipped an ocean-bound plastic card instead. Respect.

Though they decided after a while to issue a limited-edition metal card for their earliest customers, and I got the chance to put my hand on one.

Because it's otherwise exactly the same features as the original card, in this video we compare it to the ocean-bound plastic card in terms of acoustic response on different surfaces, as well as flexibility. 😏

Sit back, relax, and enjoy! ☕
