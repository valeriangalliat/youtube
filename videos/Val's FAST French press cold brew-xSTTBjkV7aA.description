Here's my super quick way of making cold brew with a French press.

For a long time I was afraid of "messing up" my cold brew, and I was checking precisely every single time how coarse the grains should be ground, how many grams of coffee and how many milliliters of water should I put, how cold the water should be, whether I should add some ice with it or not, and if so, add it before or after brewing, how long to let it brew, and so on.

Then over time I realized this didn't really matter that much, as long as you put somewhat coarse grains and you let it sit in some amount of water that doesn't look ridiculously low or high for the grains you put, for something like 12 hours.

Sure the taste will be different if your grains are a tad coarser of thinner, or if you don't put the exact same ratio of water to coffee, but do you really care? As long as you use good quality beans, it'll be tasty, trust me!

So if you're like me, this video is to encourage you to not overthink making cold brew. Don't be afraid to eyeball the quantities and adjust every parameter the way you feel it rather that following exact numbers, you can't fuck it up, really!

Oh also, for fun, I made the background music, but you probably don't give a fuck about that. I hope you like it though!
