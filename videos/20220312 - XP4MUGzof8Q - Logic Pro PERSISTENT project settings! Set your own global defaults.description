Are you frustrated by Logic using the wrong sound card in every new project, or the wrong input on every new track? Maybe you have to go in project preferences to set your favorite sample rate every time you create a new project?

You might have heard about project templates to help with that, but in this video, I show you a more hidden trick that lets you configure Logic's global default settings for every single new project!

I also talk about other things I like to do when setting up a fresh Logic Pro installation, like relocating the sound library, Apple loops and impulse responses to a hard drive to avoid using a lot of space on my SSD.
