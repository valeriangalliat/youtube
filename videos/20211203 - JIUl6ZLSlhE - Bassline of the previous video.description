When I want background music for one of my videos, I like to compose it myself, because that's a lot more fun! This is the full background music I used in the beginning of the previous video on this channel (and especially its Instagram trailer).

I had this shot of me playing the bassline that I didn't use so I figured I'd just publish it as a standalone video with boosted bass.

Feel free to use it in your own content! ✌️
