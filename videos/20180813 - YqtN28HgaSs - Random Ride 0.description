🐨 Who is FunkyVal?
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔

I'm a bassist, guitarist, photographer, videographer, brewer, as well as a programmer. Yeah, I know, I'm all over the place.

I share on this channel everything that I think could be useful to anyone, or otherwise entertaining or interesting. I don't put any limits on the topics I'll publish about. You can consider this to be a "secondary channel" even though I don't have a "main channel" per se, so don't be surprised if you subscribe! 😜

🤙 Keep in touch!
