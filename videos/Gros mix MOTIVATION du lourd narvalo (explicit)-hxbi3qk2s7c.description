Do you remember the good old time of mixtapes,  where your friend hand you off a homemade cassette labelled "funky shit" and you're like thanks dawg ima blast it on the Pioneer on the way back?

Today I'm handing you off a homemade mix of the top songs I listen to get highly motivated in the morning.

It features some of my favourite west coast rap, hip hop, reggae, electro and some juicy funkified French rap.

From Val-de-Marne to California, by Jamaica, you probably never hear those songs mixed together unless DJ Val is on the air.

Peace.
