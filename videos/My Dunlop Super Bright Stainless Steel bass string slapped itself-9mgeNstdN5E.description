I recently bought a set of Dunlop Super Bright Stainless Steel strings and was really excited to put it on, as I really like the tone of stainless steel strings and I'm trying a lot of them to find my perfect tone.

But while I was tuning the D string, the base snapped off, leaving me with just 3 strings.

Since I need 4 strings, I went to the music shop, but they didn't have any stainless steel strings. I took the Fender Nickel Plated Steel instead, which I then try in this video.

The sound of stainless steel is usually really bright and crisp, really punchy when you slap (which you can hear when I slap the Dunlop strings even though I just have 3 strings), and the Fender Nickel Plated Steel ones are not as aggressive on the high end side as stainless steel strings would. They sound rounder, but still very crisp, which is really nice as well.
