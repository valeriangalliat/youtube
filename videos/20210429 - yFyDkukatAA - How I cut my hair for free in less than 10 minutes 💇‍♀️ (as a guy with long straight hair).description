Taking care of your hair shouldn't have to be time consuming, complicated and expensive, even if you have long hair like me!

In this short video, I'll show you the technique I developed over the years to easily trim my own hair with decent enough results (at least better than if I did nothing is my definition of success here).

I do this every 3 to 6 months to get a little refresher and it does make a noticeable difference.
