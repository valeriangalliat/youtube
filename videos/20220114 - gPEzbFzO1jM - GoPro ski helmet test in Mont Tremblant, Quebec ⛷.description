Quick test to see what it looks like to mount a GoPro on my new ski helmet. "Wide" mode wasn't wide enough so I'll go for SuperView next time.

Battery drained pretty quick but that's because I left the GoPro recording by mistake for half an hour... hopefully would have done better otherwise.

Footage commentary in French because we're in Quebec. 😘
